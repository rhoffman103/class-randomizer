# Student Randomizer

Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Outline of app

This app is intended to randomize student groups for class activities and projects at the UNH Coding Bootcamp.

I will be learing to use functional components with React Hooks, { useState, useEffect, useReducer, useContext } for the functionality of this app.
